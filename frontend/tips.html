        <h4>🍽️ Proper Nutrition</h4>
        <p>Feed your dog high-quality, age-appropriate dog food twice a day. Provide fresh, clean water at all times. Consult with your vet about dietary needs based on your dog's age, size, breed, and health status. Avoid harmful foods like chocolate, grapes, and onions.</p>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>🏃 Regular Exercise</h4>
        <p>Dogs need daily exercise to stay healthy, happy, and well-behaved. The amount depends on age and breed, ranging from 30 minutes to 2+ hours daily. Activities include walks, fetch, swimming, or dog park visits. Exercise reduces anxiety and behavioral problems.</p>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>🚿 Grooming & Hygiene</h4>
        <p>Give regular baths (every 4-6 weeks), brush their coat to prevent mats, trim nails, clean ears weekly, and brush teeth daily. Good grooming keeps your dog healthy, clean, and helps you spot health issues early.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>🩺 Veterinary Care</h4>
        <p>Schedule regular check-ups at least once yearly (twice for seniors). Keep vaccinations up to date, address health concerns promptly, and get preventive care for parasites. Regular vet visits ensure early detection of potential problems.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>❤️ Affection & Attention</h4>
        <p>Dogs are social animals that crave companionship and love. Spend quality time with your dog daily, play together, cuddle, and show genuine affection. This strengthens your bond, promotes mental health, and creates a happy, secure dog.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>📚 Training & Socialization</h4>
        <p>Teach basic commands using positive reinforcement, expose your dog to different people and environments, and provide proper socialization. Well-trained dogs are happier, safer, and easier to live with. Start training early for best results.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>🛡️ Safety & Identification</h4>
        <p>Use a collar with ID tags, consider microchipping for permanent identification, and keep your home secure. Ensure toxic substances and dangerous items are out of reach. A safe environment prevents accidents and helps recover lost dogs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>🧩 Mental Stimulation</h4>
        <p>Provide toys, puzzle feeders, interactive games, and training sessions to keep your dog mentally engaged. Mental exercise prevents boredom, anxiety, and destructive behaviors. A stimulated mind contributes to overall well-being.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-card">
        <h4>💤 Rest & Comfort</h4>
        <p>Ensure your dog has a comfortable bed in a quiet, safe space. Most dogs need 12-14 hours of sleep daily. Create a stress-free environment where they can relax and recharge. Good sleep is essential for health and behavior.</p>
